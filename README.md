At the top, you will see the current round, the dealers cards, and your cards. In this case, It is the first round, The dealer has `5` and I have `10`.

Once you stand, the dealer will start to draw cards. They can draw up to 2 extra cards to try and get over your amount. If they draw both cards and go over 21 (they bust) or fail to get more than you, you win.
